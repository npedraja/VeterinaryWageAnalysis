This analysis of self-reported wage data contains 2184 responses from credentialed veterinary technicians and veterinary assistants/"on the job trained" technicians in the United States. An analysis of unemployment rates, wages compared to cost of living, and average hourly wage was performed with emphasis on identifying the difference in wages of credentialed technicians versus non-credentialed veterinary staff. This analysis demonstrates the correlation between lower wages and higher rates of unemployment in "on the job trained" staff than those who are credentialed. The data was collected from 2022-2023.
